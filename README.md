Basic Electron app for displaying your current / upcoming appointments using the Office 365 Graph API.

## Warning

This is **very** WIP.

## Instructions

First, install deps with `yarn`.

To run **just** in a browser: `yarn react-start`.
To run in a browser **and** in Electron: `yarn start`.
To build the Electron app for production: `yarn dist`.
